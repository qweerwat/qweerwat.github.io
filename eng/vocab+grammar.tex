\subsection{noun phrases}\label{noun-phrases}

ecclesiastical politics\\

With minimalist lowercase at the beginning, I make myself approachable:
like \hl{a self-deprecating joke at the beginning of a public speech}, I

someone else might lecture me for}.\\
he was in the position of power, \emph{the position of being able to
make decisions which affect other people\textquotesingle s lives}

In that moment, this thread was \hl{the fulfillment of a dream belonging
to centuries of writers, from Rousseau to The Onion}\\
it was \emph{a result of long work which required coordinating hundreds

person\textquotesingle s} mind
