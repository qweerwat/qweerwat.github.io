is a form of (incorrect) argument where an arguer conflates two positions, one modest and easy to defend (the "motte") and one much more controversial and harder to defend (the "bailey").

coined by Nicholas Shackel in his _The Vacuity of Postmodernist Methodology_, but there it was motte-and-bailey _doctrines_
